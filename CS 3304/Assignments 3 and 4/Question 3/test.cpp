    Q1 (15 pts). Quick sort. Given the array of numbers, show the elements of the array after each
    split operation of quick sort. The algorithm will sort the array in increasing order. Select the first
    element as pivot in each split. For instance, use 49 as pivot in the first iteration and show the
    array elements after split. Then, in the second iteration, apply split operation to left sublist and
    right sublist. You can continue splits until you have 0 or 1 element in sublists.
